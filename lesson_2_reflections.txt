What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is created to keep track of changes
You need to do it to be able to take snapshots of your directory contents each time you make a commit
Repository enables you to log changes to files within the directory and checkout previous versions of the directory contents at the time of each commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different from the working directory in that you do not have to include entire working directory
It is different from the repository in that it defines what will be included in the commit
Staging area allows you to single out certain file(s) for inclusion into commit
